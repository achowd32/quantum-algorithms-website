# Quantum Algorithms Website
A simple website showcasing various quantum algorithms. Supports interactive quantum algorithms like Shor's Algorithm, Grover's Algorithm, and the Quantum Fourier Transform. Interact with the website to learn more about your favorite quantum algorithms and develop an intuition for the algorithms in quesetion.

## Planned Features and To-Dos
Currently a work in progress, intended completion of version 1.0 by fall 2025 as an introduction/onboarding for new members of Quantum Computing @ Brown. Intended features:
- Add a page for QAOA
- Implement VQLS and add corresponding page
- Add greater interactivity to test users knowledge/understanding
- Add login for users to save pages/features/progress
- Improve UI
  - Divide webpages into sections for code, visualization, interactivity, etc.
